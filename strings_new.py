In Java, a **string** is a sequence of characters and is represented by the `String` class, which is part of the `java.lang` package. Unlike primitive data types, strings in Java are **objects**.

#### **1. String Creation**
Strings can be created in two main ways:  
- **Using string literals:**  
  ```java
  String str1 = "Hello";
  ```
  Strings created this way are stored in the **string pool** for memory optimization.
  
- **Using the `new` keyword:**  
  ```java
  String str2 = new String("Hello");
  ```
  This forces the creation of a new object in the heap memory.

#### **2. String Immutability**
Strings in Java are **immutable**, meaning once a string object is created, it cannot be modified. Any modification (concatenation, replacement, etc.) creates a new string object.

#### **3. Common String Operations**
Java provides many built-in methods to manipulate strings:

- **Concatenation:**
  ```java
  String fullName = "John" + " Doe";  // Using + operator
  String fullName2 = "John".concat(" Doe");  // Using concat()
  ```

- **Finding Length:**
  ```java
  int len = "Hello".length();
  ```

- **Accessing Characters:**
  ```java
  char ch = "Hello".charAt(1); // 'e'
  ```

- **Substring Extraction:**
  ```java
  String sub = "Hello".substring(1, 4); // "ell"
  ```

- **Comparison:**
  ```java
  boolean isEqual = "hello".equals("Hello"); // false
  boolean isEqualIgnoreCase = "hello".equalsIgnoreCase("Hello"); // true
  ```

- **Searching for a Character or Substring:**
  ```java
  int index = "Hello".indexOf('e');  // 1
  ```


- **Splitting a String:**
  ```java
  String[] words = "Java,Python,C++".split(",");
  ```

- **Converting to Upper or Lower Case:**
  ```java
  String upper = "hello".toUpperCase(); // "HELLO"
  String lower = "HELLO".toLowerCase(); // "hello"
  ```

  ```

#### **4. String Formatting**
Java provides the `String.format()` method for formatted output.
```java
String formatted = String.format("Name: %s, Age: %d", "Alice", 25);
```
